GIMP
    To prepare the tiles I used GIMP. First I selected one hex using free
    selection tool and changed the selection to path (select->to path) ,so that
    i can move the image and the selection independently. 
    Then I selected the tile to be copied with select->from path (SHIFT + V),
    copied it (CTRL+C) and created new png image from selection (CTRL + SHIFT +
    V). I moved the image so that the path selected new hex and repeated the
    process till all is done.

Django
        To start django: django-admin.py startproject (name CatanBoard)
        Had to add to settings (CatanBoard/settings.py): 
            INSTALLED_APPS: CatanBoard
            Changed timezone and language
            Set STATIC_URL for images to (so that we can get them through:
                http_address/static/real_path):
                'static'
            Set STATIC_ROOT folder for the place where django should place
                static files.

            Place static files in CatanBoard APP(!) in folder static.
            Then run python manage collectstatic to make django copy static
            images to selected folder ('templates/') and prepare them.

        Had a little fight with HTML the problems i solved are:
            How to display overlapping images (position:absolute)
            How to display text on images (as above)
            Text align (notice vertical-align and line-height)

        To run django on given ip and port run:
            django manage-py
